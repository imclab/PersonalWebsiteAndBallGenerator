ball generator app

The ball is generated by first creating a line on the major axis of a sphere.  
I record the intersections between this line and a set of concentric spheres.
By sweeping the line along the axis and rotating at either end, a bent loop is
created.  This process is done for every angle specified by the surfaces parameter,
which is controlled by a html range. The thickness is genated by offsetting the line
up and down by half the value of the thickness range. 

I used three js to turn the numeric output into vertices and faces.  The faces are
drawn by looping through all the distinct surfaces as they are created and joining them
into closed surfaces.  In this way the object is created as single geometry object while
mainting distinct components.  

When the user submits his email the value from the parameter ranges is sent up to the surver.
The server then duplicates the ball geometry as a pair of arrays.  One for faces and one 
for vertices. This data is then stringified into OBJ format and attached to an email using a
node mailer.
